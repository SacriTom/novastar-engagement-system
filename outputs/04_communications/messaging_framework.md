# NovaStar Post-Stay Engagement -- Messaging Framework

**Prepared by:** Casey the Communicator (Agent 04, Team AWESOME)
**Date:** 10 February 2026

---

## 1. Master Tagline

**"We Remember. You Return."**

## 2. Value Proposition (One-Liner)

NovaStar remembers every detail of your stay and uses it to make your next one even better -- with personalised recommendations, real rewards, and local experiences you will not find anywhere else.

## 3. Elevator Pitch (50 Words)

Most hotels forget you the moment you check out. NovaStar does the opposite. Our AI-powered engagement system remembers your preferences, suggests your perfect next trip, and rewards you every time you book direct. It is the consistency of a great hotel chain with the personal touch of your favourite local host.

## 5. Tone Guidelines

### Brand Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What It Sounds Like | What It Never Sounds Like |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Warm** | "We saved your favourite pillow preference." | "Dear Valued Guest, your profile has been updated." |
| **Personal** | "Sarah, your Austin memories are ready to relive." | "Guest #48291, click here for your stay summary." |
| **Aspirational** | "Your next adventure starts with one tap." | "Book now before this deal expires!!!" |
| **Trustworthy** | "Best price guaranteed -- we check so you don't have to." | "UNBEATABLE PRICES! ACT NOW!" |
| **Playful** | "The kids have already packed. Have you?" | "Attention: a promotional offer is available." |

### Do / Don't Quick Reference

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use the guest's first name | Use "Dear Valued Guest" or "Dear Member" |
| Reference specific stay details (city, dates, room) | Send generic copy with no personalisation |
| Lead with value, not the ask | Open with "Book now" or "Don't miss out" |
| Write like a friendly concierge | Write like a corporate marketing department |
| Use contractions (you're, we've, it's) | Use stiff formal language (we would like to inform you) |
| Keep subject lines under 45 characters | Use ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation |
| Include one clear CTA per message | Stack multiple competing CTAs |
| Acknowledge the guest's segment context | Treat every guest identically |
| Respect opt-out preferences immediately | Send messages after unsubscribe |

### Voice Test

Before sending any communication, apply this test: "Would a thoughtful hotel concierge who remembers this guest say it this way?" If no, rewrite.
