## 2. Three-Touch Sequence

### Touch 1 -- "We Still Remember" (Day 1)

**Goal:** Emotional re-engagement through nostalgia. No hard sell.

**Subject Line:** "Your [City] stay -- we kept the memories"
**Preview Text:** A quick look back at your time with us.

**Body:**
> Hi [First Name],
>
> A little while ago, you spent [X nights] with us at NovaStar [Property Name] in [City]. We hope [City] treated you well.
>
> We have been making some changes since your visit -- and we kept a few things just for you. Your stay highlights are waiting inside your NovaStar profile.
>
> Take a look. It only takes a moment.
>
> [CTA Button: "See Your Stay Highlights"]
>
> Warmly,
> The NovaStar [City] Team

**Design Notes:** Hero image of the property. No discount. No loyalty pitch. Pure emotional anchoring.

### Touch 2 -- "Here's Why Guests Come Back" (Day 14)

**Goal:** Introduce the new loyalty programme and direct-booking value. Social proof.

**Subject Line:** "NovaStar just got a whole lot more rewarding"
**Preview Text:** New perks, new tiers, and 500 points on us.

**Body:**
> Hi [First Name],
>
> Since your stay at NovaStar [City], we have completely reimagined what it means to be a NovaStar guest.
>
> Introducing the new **NovaStar Rewards**:
> - **4 tiers** with real perks: room upgrades, late checkout, free breakfast
> - **Points that matter** -- earn on every direct booking, redeem for nights, dining, or local experiences
> - **Your preferences, remembered** -- across all 45 properties
>
> As a welcome-back gift, we are adding **500 bonus points** to your account when you sign up. That is halfway to a guaranteed late checkout.
>
> [CTA Button: "Join & Claim 500 Points"]
>
> See you again soon,
> The NovaStar Team

**Design Notes:** Feature-focused layout with tier visual. Include "4,200 guests rebooked at NovaStar [City] this year" social proof line.

### Touch 3 -- "Your Personal Offer" (Day 30)

**Goal:** Conversion push with a time-limited, segment-appropriate offer.

**Subject Line:** "[First Name], this one's just for you"
**Preview Text:** A personal rate for your next NovaStar stay. 7 days only.

**Body:**
> Hi [First Name],
>
> We wanted to reach out one more time. We have put together a personal offer for your return to NovaStar -- and it is only available for the next 7 days.
>
> **Your offer: [Segment-specific -- see Section 3 below]**
>
> Book direct at novastar.com or through the NovaStar app to claim it. Your best price is guaranteed -- we check so you do not have to.
>
> [CTA Button: "Book With Your Personal Rate"]
>
> We would love to welcome you back.
> [GM Name], General Manager, NovaStar [City]
>
> *P.S. This offer expires [date]. After that, it goes to another guest on our waitlist.*
