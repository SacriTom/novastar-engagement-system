# NovaStar On-Property Communications Playbook

## 1. Front-Desk Checkout Script

**Goal:** Capture direct contact information and set up the post-stay engagement pipeline before the guest walks out the door. Current data capture rate: 43%. Target: 75%.

### The 90-Second Checkout Flow

**Step 1 -- Confirm satisfaction (15 seconds)**

> "How was your stay with us, [Guest Name]? Everything comfortable?"

*Listen. Note any specific feedback in the PMS guest notes field. This feeds the AI Personalisation Engine.*

**Step 2 -- Capture email / mobile (30 seconds)**

For OTA guests (masked email on file):

> "I noticed your booking came through [OTA name], so we don't have your direct email. If you'd like, I can send your stay recap and any future NovaStar offers straight to you -- no spam, just things relevant to your trip. Could I get your preferred email?"

For guests with no mobile on file:

> "Would you like a text confirmation of your checkout and points earned? I just need your mobile number."

*Key: Always offer something in return (stay recap, checkout confirmation, points summary). Never ask for data without a value exchange.*

**Step 3 -- Loyalty prompt (30 seconds, non-members only)**

> "By the way, have you heard about the new NovaStar Rewards? It's free to join and you'd start as an Explorer with [X] points from this stay. That gets you member-only rates and a room upgrade pathway. Want me to set it up? It takes about 20 seconds."

*If they decline: "No problem at all. If you change your mind, there's a link in the checkout email."*

**Step 4 -- Warm farewell (15 seconds)**

> "Thanks so much for staying with us, [Guest Name]. You'll get your stay recap by email within a couple of hours. We'd love to welcome you back."

### Staff Training Notes

- Do NOT rush. Quality of this interaction matters more than checkout speed. KPI has been updated from "checkout speed" to "checkout completeness" (data fields captured + loyalty pitch delivered).
- If the queue is long, hand the guest a checkout card (see Section 3) with a QR code to self-serve the data capture and loyalty sign-up.
- Log all preferences mentioned in conversation (pillow type, room temperature, noise sensitivity) into the PMS guest notes. The Guest Data Platform will sync these across properties.

## 2. Concierge Conversation Prompts

**Goal:** Build guest preference data organically through genuine hospitality conversations. Every preference captured enriches the AI profile for post-stay personalisation.

### During the Stay -- Natural Prompts

| Moment | Prompt | What to Capture |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Restaurant recommendation request** | "Are you celebrating anything special, or just exploring the local food scene?" | Dining style, occasion, dietary preferences |
| **Activity enquiry** | "Are you looking for something relaxing or more of an adventure?" | Activity preferences, energy level, interests |
| **Family interaction** | "How old are the kids? I can suggest some things they'd really enjoy." | Child ages, family activity preferences |
| **Business guest asking about transport** | "Is this a quick work trip or will you have some free time to explore?" | Trip purpose, free time availability, interest in local content |
| **Return guest recognised** | "Welcome back! Last time you mentioned you loved [X]. Want to try something new, or stick with a winner?" | Validates existing preferences, signals recognition |
| **Check-in small talk** | "What brings you to [City] this time?" | Trip purpose, event context, travel companions |

### Logging Protocol

After every meaningful guest interaction, concierge enters a 1-2 line note in the PMS:
- Format: `[Date] [Concierge initials]: [Preference/insight]`
- Example: `10/02 CS: Couple celebrating 5th anniversary. Loves Italian food. Asked about sunrise viewpoints.`

These notes are ingested by the Guest Data Platform and used by the AI Personalisation Engine for post-stay content (e.g., "Next time you're in Barcelona for an anniversary, here are 3 sunrise spots you haven't tried").
